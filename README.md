Crustacean community structure assessment in biomonitoring of coastal systems

Jonathon Shaw/Macquarie University/jonathon.shaw1@hdr.mq.edu.au

Estuaries worldwide face diverse human-induced pressures that threaten the unique biodiversity of these systems. These pressures pose significant threats to the structure and functioning of estuarine communities, rendering them more susceptible to colonization by non-indigenous species. Crustacean water-column communities are exposed to elevated nutrient and pesticide inputs from intensive adjacent agriculture in Queensland's Mackay-Whitsunday region. Here we looked at three water column communities with varying levels of anthropogenic disturbance. To gain knowledge of community composition and species abundance, DNA metabarcoding was used to target crustaceans.
